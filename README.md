# GeniusFoxGame

To increase the children's strategic thinking and planning, we created an adventurous strategy game using Unity and OpenGL. The most essential benefit of completing this project was achieving our initial aim of creating two scenes with one main character. Other benefits were learning to apply what we had learned in class, learning to look for resources to learn more, and learning how to select the right tool to utilize.

## How to play?

Start by using The arrows to move the fox and the mouse pad to change the direction, keep crossing the city until
you find the food truck hidden in a house's front yard, once you get there a questions panel will appear with 4 answers too choose from,
you have to answer the questions in time in order to win.
